## v0.6.0 - BHC Platform Ecosystem

The pivot point. hx stops being "a nice wrapper around GHC/Cabal" and starts
becoming the integrated toolchain — where hx + BHC is to Haskell what
cargo + rustc is to Rust.

### BHC Platform Expansion
- [ ] `bhc-platform-2026.2` snapshot (expanded package set, ~120 packages)
  - [ ] Broader web coverage: scotty, yesod-core, IHP-core
  - [ ] Broader data coverage: cassava, xlsx, postgresql-simple
  - [ ] Broader crypto: crypton, tls, x509
- [ ] Remote snapshot registry
  - [ ] `hx bhc-platform update` — fetch latest snapshot index from registry
  - [ ] Snapshot TOML served from `https://bhc-platform.raskell.io/`
  - [ ] Offline fallback to last-fetched + embedded snapshots
  - [ ] Signed snapshots (Ed25519 signature verification)
- [ ] Snapshot diffing
  - [ ] `hx bhc-platform diff <old> <new>` — show added/removed/upgraded packages
  - [ ] Migration hints when upgrading snapshots
- [ ] Custom/overlay snapshots
  - [ ] `[bhc-platform] overlay = "path/to/overlay.toml"` for org-private packages
  - [ ] Merge strategy: overlay wins over base snapshot

### BHC-Native Build Pipeline
- [ ] `hx build` invokes BHC directly (no Cabal intermediary for BHC projects)
  - [ ] hx owns the full build graph: resolve → fetch → compile → link
  - [ ] Module dependency extraction from BHC (not GHC)
  - [ ] Parallel compilation via BHC's native parallelism
- [ ] Incremental compilation aware of BHC's interface files
- [ ] Content-addressed build cache shared between BHC projects
  - [ ] `hx cache` stores compiled BHC artifacts keyed by (package, version, profile, flags)
  - [ ] Cross-project cache sharing (like cargo's target/ but smarter)
- [ ] BHC-native REPL
  - [ ] `hx repl --backend bhc` with BHC interactive mode
  - [ ] Hot-reload of modules without full recompilation

### Zero-Config Experience
- [ ] `hx new <name>` defaults to BHC when BHC is installed and no GHC present
- [ ] `hx toolchain install` installs BHC + hx-managed toolchain as one unit
  - [ ] Single command from zero to building: `hx toolchain install && hx new my-app && cd my-app && hx run`
- [ ] Auto-select BHC Platform snapshot matching installed BHC version
- [ ] `hx doctor` checks BHC Platform compatibility, suggests upgrades

---

## v0.7.0 - Cargo Parity

The moment hx achieves full cargo-level ergonomics. A new Haskell developer
installs hx, types three commands, and has a running project with deps resolved,
tests passing, and formatting applied. No Stack. No Cabal. No GHCup.
Just `hx`.

### hx-native Package Registry
- [ ] `hx publish` to raskell.io registry (BHC-verified packages)
  - [ ] Package upload with BHC build verification
  - [ ] Automated doc generation and hosting
  - [ ] Provenance attestation (who built, when, from which source)
- [ ] `hx search` against raskell.io registry
- [ ] `hx add <package>` resolves from raskell.io first, Hackage fallback
- [ ] Yanking, ownership transfer, team-based permissions

### hx-native Resolver
- [ ] Replace hx-solver's Hackage-based resolution with BHC Platform-aware resolver
  - [ ] Resolver understands BHC profiles (packages may have profile-specific bounds)
  - [ ] Resolver understands BHC-specific flags and build configurations
  - [ ] Sub-second resolution for Platform-pinned projects
- [ ] `hx lock` produces fully reproducible builds without network access
  - [ ] Content hashes for all sources in lockfile
  - [ ] Lockfile includes BHC version, profile, platform snapshot

### Binary Installation
- [ ] `hx install <package>` — build and install a binary to `~/.hx/bin/`
  - [ ] Like `cargo install`: fetch, build, link, put on PATH
  - [ ] Pre-built binary cache (download instead of compile when available)
  - [ ] `hx install --list` to see installed binaries
  - [ ] `hx uninstall <package>`

### Workspaces 2.0
- [ ] `hx workspace` commands for multi-package monorepos
  - [ ] `hx workspace init` — create workspace root
  - [ ] `hx workspace add <path>` — add member
  - [ ] Per-member BHC profiles (server member uses `server`, lib uses `default`)
- [ ] Workspace-level BHC Platform snapshot (shared across all members)
- [ ] Selective rebuilds: only recompile affected members

### Build Scripts
- [ ] `[build] script = "build.hs"` — custom build logic in Haskell
  - [ ] Replaces Setup.hs with a simpler, hx-aware API
  - [ ] Access to project config, dependency info, BHC compiler flags
  - [ ] Runs in a sandbox with only declared dependencies

---

## v0.8.0 - Production Grade

### Reproducible Environments
- [ ] `hx env` — Nix-like environment pinning without Nix
  - [ ] `hx env lock` — capture exact toolchain + deps + system libs
  - [ ] `hx env shell` — enter reproducible shell
  - [ ] `hx env export` — generate Docker/OCI image from environment
- [ ] Hermetic builds: same source + same lockfile = identical binary (bit-for-bit)

### Deploy Pipeline
- [ ] `hx deploy` — build, package, and ship
  - [ ] `hx deploy docker` — generate optimized multi-stage Dockerfile
  - [ ] `hx deploy lambda` — package for AWS Lambda
  - [ ] `hx deploy fly` — deploy to Fly.io
  - [ ] `hx deploy static` — produce fully static binary (musl)

### Integrated Profiling
- [ ] `hx profile` with BHC-native profiling
  - [ ] Flame graphs from BHC runtime
  - [ ] Allocation tracking per module
  - [ ] `hx profile --web` — browser-based profiling viewer
- [ ] `hx bench` with automatic regression detection
  - [ ] Store historical benchmarks in `.hx/benchmarks/`
  - [ ] CI integration: fail build on performance regression

### Language Server
- [ ] `hx lsp` as full language server (not just HLS wrapper)
  - [ ] BHC-powered type checking (faster than GHC for BHC projects)
  - [ ] Completion, go-to-definition, find-references from BHC's API
  - [ ] Inline type hints, inlay hints
  - [ ] Code actions: add import, fill hole, case split

---

## Future — Nice to Have

These are valuable but not on the critical path to "cargo for Haskell."
They'll happen when the core story is solid.

### Cloud Builds
- [ ] Remote build execution
  - [ ] Build server protocol
  - [ ] Distributed compilation
  - [ ] Result caching and sharing
  - [ ] `hx build --remote` for offloading to build farm

### Package Ecosystem Analysis
- [ ] Dependency health scores (maintenance, test coverage, download stats)
- [ ] Supply chain audit: transitive dependency risk analysis
- [ ] License compatibility matrix across full dependency tree

### IDE Plugins
- [ ] First-party VS Code extension (hx + BHC LSP)
- [ ] IntelliJ/IDEA plugin
- [ ] Neovim plugin with native LSP configuration

### WebAssembly Story
- [ ] `hx build --target wasm` as first-class workflow
  - [ ] WASI preview 2 support
  - [ ] Browser target with JS interop
  - [ ] wasm-opt integration for size optimization

---

## Vision: cargo for Haskell

The thesis is straightforward: Rust succeeded not just because of the language,
but because `cargo` made the entire experience feel *inevitable*. You never
wonder how to start a project, add a dependency, run tests, or publish a
library. It just works.

Haskell has a better type system than almost any mainstream language. But the
tooling story — GHCup, Cabal, Stack, Hackage, Stackage, hie.yaml, HLS
configuration — is the #1 reason people bounce off it. Every year, "Haskell
setup hell" costs the ecosystem more potential users than any language feature
could attract.

**hx + BHC is the answer.** The strategic arc:

```
v0.1–v0.3:  Wrap       hx orchestrates GHC, Cabal, GHCup, HLS
v0.4–v0.5:  Tame       hx adds BHC as alternative backend, curated snapshots
v0.6–v0.7:  Own        hx builds BHC projects natively, owns the registry
v0.8+:      Complete   hx is the single tool from `install` to `deploy`
```

### What "cargo for Haskell" means concretely

| Cargo experience | hx equivalent | Status |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| `rustup install` | `hx toolchain install` | ✅ Done |
| `cargo new` | `hx new` | ✅ Done |
| `cargo build` | `hx build` | ✅ Done |
| `cargo test` | `hx test` | ✅ Done |
| `cargo run` | `hx run` | ✅ Done |
| `cargo fmt` | `hx fmt` | ✅ Done |
| `cargo clippy` | `hx lint` | ✅ Done |
| `cargo add` | `hx add` | ✅ Done |
| `cargo publish` | `hx publish` | ✅ Done (Hackage) |
| `cargo install` | `hx install` | v0.7.0 |
| `crates.io` | raskell.io registry | v0.7.0 |
| Rust editions | BHC Platform snapshots | ✅ Foundation done |
| `cargo bench` | `hx bench` | ✅ Done |
| `cargo doc` | `hx docs` | ✅ Done |

### The end state

```bash
# A new developer's entire Haskell experience:
curl -fsSL https://hx.raskell.io/install.sh | sh   # installs hx + BHC
hx new server my-api                                 # scaffolds project
cd my-api
hx run                                               # builds and runs
hx test                                              # runs tests
hx add aeson servant                                 # adds dependencies
hx lock                                              # locks versions
hx publish                                           # ships to registry
```

No Stack. No Cabal. No GHCup. No Stackage. No hie.yaml.
Just `hx`.
